\subsection{Profile}
\cvitem{}{
I'm a final year postgraduate student looking to continue research in \acp{GW}, in particular finalising a coherent search for compact binary coalescence signals, and developing tools for second-generation GW detector characterisation.
\newline\newline
Research interests:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\leftmargin}{5pt}
\item development of a fully-coherent, all-sky, all-time search for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences,
\item detector characterisation for the second-generation network in preparation for the first Advanced Science Run.
\end{itemize}}
