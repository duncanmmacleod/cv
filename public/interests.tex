Most of my time outside of study is spent on music.
Having played the trumpet since the age of 10 I have been involved in multiple musical group within Edinburgh, as principal trumpet of the University Symphony Orchestra, for four years, and in \textit{Scottish Sinfonia}, and more recently in Cardiff, as principal trumpet of both the University Symphony Orchestra and Chamber Orchestra.
\newline\newline
I have also started a series of web development projects, including websites for Bobby Kaner's Newblood (\link[]{bknewblood.com}) and myself (\link[]{duncanmmacleod.com}).}
