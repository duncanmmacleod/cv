\subsection{Profile}
\cvitem{}{
A final year research postgraduate in the process of writing a doctoral thesis.
Research interests include developing a fully-coherent, all-sky, all-time search for gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences, and developing tools for second-generation GW detector characterisation.
Personal interests include computer programming in python, and web development in HTML 5.0, as well as playing the trumpet as much as the rest of my time allows.}
