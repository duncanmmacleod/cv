\cventry{2009 -- 2013}{PhD}{Cardiff University}{}{}%
    {Ph.D. (research) with the Gravitational Waves group (School of Physics %
     and Astronomy) analysing data from gravitational-wave detectors for %
     compact-binary coalescence signals, development of a coherent search for %
     these signals that will improve search sensitivity, and detector %
     characterisation for first- and second-generation laser interferometers.}
